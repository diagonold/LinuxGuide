	regex are like wildcards, they help us create patterns
	ussually use to identify and manipulate specific pieces of data
	
materials and examples:
	1. $egrep [command line options] <pattern> [path]
		egrep is a command that helps us search a given pattern 
		just like wildcards, we are given tools to create our own expressions that has a lot of uses
		egrep looks at a file and checks if the pattern is there and then, returns the whole line that contained that pattern

		[^agd] - the character is not one of those included within the square brackets.
		[c-f] - the dash within the square brackets operates as a range. In this case it means either the letters c, d, e or f.

introduction: 
	Just like any operating system, linux has many processes going on at one time.
	This process can be checked with the command 'top'
materials and examples:
	1. 'top'
			this command lets us check all the processes happening in computer at any given time.
			useful information such as our RAM usage and our virtual memory system
			What is vistual memory?
				we can simply think of it as a memory management technique involving hardware and software in order
				manage shared memory space, memory isolation and increase capacity of memory.
	2. ps [aux]
			this stands for processes.
			this will how you the current processes running in your terminal
			adding aux will give a  complete system view
	3.kill [signal] <ID>
			when a process/application hang or locks up, we are able to kill and reser it with kill
			first look for the hang process ID from the command line.
			We can control the way we wkill th process.    
			By default it will send signal -1 which will send a code saying "please nicely quit"
			sending a signal of -9 will send ' make sure that process is killed, no matter what'
	4. Multiple virtual consoles on linux	
			This gives us access to another virtual console if one is hanged.
			if desktop is hang, we can go to the next console and access process ID 
			and kill processes that hangs up the system. 
			ctrl + alt  + F2 ------------ command line console
			ctrl + alt + F7  ------------ GUI console
	5. jobs and &
			with  this command we can see the forward and backward jobs.
			with the symbol '&' amspersand, we can send jobs to the background 
			then we can see the progress of these jobs with jobs
	6. fg <job number>
			we can use this to bring jobs from background to foreground
			this is as long as you know the job number
			job number can be find as the 1st column of the output of the command jobs

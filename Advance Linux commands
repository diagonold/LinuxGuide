1.sed
	also known as stream editor
	this tool is used to replace, append or delete text in files
	this is done without even opening them
	we can also use regular expression to create patterns for the script section
	syntax:
	$ sed optoions [scripts] [input file]
	
2.cut
	this helps in cutting sections from each line of files 
	and then writing the result to a standard ouput
	[official] 
	used to cut parts of a line by byte postion, charactrer and delimiter. it can also
	be used to cut data from file formats like csv

	syntax:
	to cut out a section of a line by specifying byte position use -b option.
	remember that this the byte option, this is assuming that all your characters are 1 byte
		echo 'bad' | cut -b 2
		echo hello | cut -b 1-3 , cutting a range
	to cut by character, use the -c option, this is more convenient than -b
	some characters such as symbols are not just 1 character
	usage of -c and -b option is the same
	
	cutting based on delimiter
	cut using -d option
	normally used with option -f to specify the field that should be cut
		cut -d ',' -f 1 names .csv
	cut checks each line, it separate each line by that delimiter
	with -f, we can choose which section/field we want to pull out
	this section will then be returned as a standard output	

3.tee
	i think its for appendin text to files without opening them

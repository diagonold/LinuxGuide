Introduction
	Finding your way around linux is like a game.
	there is actually a game from mit that allows you to learn how to navigate in the linux system
	in a game-like system.
	the game is called http://web.mit.edu/mprat/Public/web/Terminus/Web/main.html
	Go ahead and play with it if you are up to challenge yourself.
	
materials and examples
	1. where am i?
		$pwd
		this will print our current working directory
	2. where can i go?
		$ls [option] [location]
		this will show us what is in our current location
		$ls -l [location]
		$total 3
		$drwxr-xr-x  2 ryan users 4096 Mar 23 13:34 bin
		$drwxr-xr-x 18 ryan users 4096 Feb 17 09:12 Documents
		$drwxr-xr-x  2 ryan users 4096 May 05 17:25 public_html
		-l means long listing
		it gives us a lot of info regarding the directory
		total, gives us the total number of files in the directory and its subdirectories
		the first character tells us whether it is a file or a directory
		the next 9 characters are permissions of the file or directory
		the next field is the numner of blocks.... not sure what blocks are though
		the next field is the owner of file or directory
		the next field is the group or the file the firectory belongs too.
		this could either be from different partoes such as the users or the root user or administrators
		the next field is the file size
		the next field is the time of modification
		the last field is the actual name of file or directory
	3. path
		Need to appreciate that linux is a hierarirchal system that begins at the very top with the root directory
		3a. absolute path
			Easiest way to identify relative path is to look at the beginning of the path.
			if it starts with /, then yes it is an absolute path
			try this:
			$pwd 
			you will see that the current working direcotry that is printed is always an abolute path
		3b. relative path
			relative paths specify a location regarding your current location in the system
			thus they will not start with a slash.
		3c. more on paths
			Though paths are very usefule there are still shortcuts to ease your life
			(~) this refers to your home directory
			(.) this refers to your current directory
				eg.  ./[absolute path of desired directory or file]
			(..) this refers to the parent directory, which means if you cd to that path, you will move up
				to the parent level.
	6. moving around
		cd stands for change directory
		cd [location]
		if you run cd without any command, it will bring you to your home directory

introduction
	vi is a text editor that only has 2 functions , inserting and editing
	it can be access in the terminal. removes the need for any mouse
	in essence it is a command line text editor. 
materials and examples
	1. To initialize
		$vi <file>
		the file can either be an absolute or relative path
		if file is not created , vi will create it for you
	2. insert or editing
		take note that we always start in edit mode.
		insert: input or enter content into the filename
			press i to insert
		edit: perform actions such as copying deleting, search and replace
			press esc to go back to edit mode
		
	3. saving and exiting
		$ZZ----- capital letters for save and exit
		$:q----- discard all changes, since the last save and exit
		$:w ---- save file but dont exit
		$:wq ---save file and exit
		when there is a colon there, we need to enter.
		
	4. Other ways to view files.
		$cat <file>
		this stands for concatenate but we can simply think of it as a way to view files
		$less <file>
		for larger files, this is much better. cat only allows you to see last page of the content.
	5. deleting content
	6. undoing
		press u to undo the last action
		press U to undo all the chanes in the current line

introduction:
	just your essential scripting tools
	need to get familiar with the syntax
content:
1.basic if statements
	if [<some test>]
	then 
		<commands, perform this task if true>
	fi
	
	what is more important to know is the kind of conditionals that we can perform
	these are the conditionals allowed inside the square brackets
	! expression
	-n string		not empty string
	-z string		empty string 
	string1 == string2		both strings are equal		
	string1 != string2		string1 is not equal to string 2
	interger1 -eq interger2		int1 is equal to int2
	interger1 -gt interger2		int1 is greater thatn int2
	interger1 -lt interger2		int1 is less than int2 
	&&		stands for and
	!		stands for not
	||		stands for or
	
	file conditions:
	-d file		file is a directory
	-e file		file exists
	-r file		file is readable
	-s file		file is a symbolic link
	-w file 	file is writable
	-x file		file is executable
	file1 -nt file2		1 is more recent than 2
	file1 -ot file2		2 is more recent than 1
	file1 -ef file2		1 and 2 is the same file.
	when we refer to a file we actually mean a path, we actually mean a path to a file.
	
	test <conditional>
	this will store the result into $?
	this will lead to either 1(false) or 0(true)
2. indenting
	there are no indenting rules for bash scripting
	indenting is a good practice that helps with readability
	
3. nested if statements

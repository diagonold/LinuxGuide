introduction:
	just your essential scripting tools
	need to get familiar with the syntax
content:
1.basic if statements
	if [<some test>]
	then 
		<commands, perform this task if true>
	fi
	
	what is more important to know is the kind of conditionals that we can perform
	these are the conditionals allowed inside the square brackets
	! expression
	-n strng
	-z string
	string1 = string2
	string1 != string2
	interger1 -eq interger2
	interger1 -gt interger2
	interger1 -lt interger2
	-d file
	-e file
	-r file
	-s file
	-w file 
	-x file
	when we refer to a file we actually mean a path, we actually mean a path to a file.
	
	test <conditional>

	this will lead to either 1(false) or 0(true)
2. indenting
	there are no indenting rules for bash scripting
	indenting is a good practice that helps with readability
	
3. nested if statements

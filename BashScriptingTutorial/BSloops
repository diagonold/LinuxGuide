Introduction 
	just useful stuff for loops
	for automating repetitive tasks
materials and examples

1.for loops
	syntax:
		for (item) in (list)
			do
			<commands>
			done
	how to create a list?
		many ways to create a list
		sampleList = 'item1 item2 item3'
		
	
2.while loops
	syntax:
	while [[<some test>]];
	do 
		<commands>
	done



3.until loops
	similar to a for loop.
	difference is that it will execute the commands until the test become true
	syntax:
	until [[ <some test> ]];
		do
			<commands>
		done
4.ranges
	this will help create interget ranges shortcut
	eg.
	{1..5}	is equivalent to 1 2 3 4 5 
	
	{1..20..5}	create a list from 1 to 20 with intervals of 5


5. controlling loops with break and continue
	break the loop straight away
	continue tells bash to stop running through this iteration of the loop
			then begin the next iteration


6. Select
	this allows us to create simple menu system
	syntax:
	select <item> in <list>
		do
		<command>
		done

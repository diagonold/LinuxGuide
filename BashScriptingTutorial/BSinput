Introduction: Inputs
	command line arguments are 1 form of user input tha we have learnt
	Here , we will discover other ways to provide input to the bash script
	

content:

1. read <variable name>
	to ask the user input from a running bashscript
	this takes the user's response and stores it to a variable
	eg:
	echo what is your name
	read name
	echo so your name is $name
	
	more can be done with read with the help of options
	-p	stands for prompt, which allows you to specify a string prompt
	-s 	stands for silent
	
	
	we can also used read for multiple input items
	eg:
	#!/bin/bash
	echo what are your favourite drinks
	read drink1 drink2 drink3
	
	if the user enters 1 drink only, drink1 has a value while the rest are null values
	if the user enters 4 drinks or more, the other drinks will be stored in drink3
	
2. Piping, manipulation f stdin, stdout and stderr
	basically command line interface commands and choosing only the outputs that you need
	this allows us to automate commands together

Introduction:
	an important skill to learn in bash scripting
	after arithemtic we will head over to arithematic expansion
	arithmetic is like math
Content:
1.let <arithmetic expression>
	lets you save a result to mousepad
	eg:
		$let a=5+6
		$echo $a
	the result is 11
	there is no space between the expression.
	unless there are quotes.
	remember how to use variables, placed the dollar sign before the variable name
	
2. expr item1 operator item2
	insted read of storing the value, this prints the value 
	eg:
		$expr 5 + 4
		the result of this is 5+4
		$exp 5+4
		the result of this is 9

3. (()) double parentheses
	this lets us save the output of the command easily to a variable 
	thus we can do stuff like this
	eg:
		$ a = $((4 + 5 ))
		$ ((a++))	#allows an increment of 1 on the same variable
		$ ((a+= 10))	#same expression as a = a + 10
		
4. finding the length of a variable
	${#variable}
	eg:
	$ a='Hello world"
	$ echo ${#a}

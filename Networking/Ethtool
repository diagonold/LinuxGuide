Ethtool 
	a networking utility on linux
	used to configure ethernet device on linux

1. check availability of ethtool
	sudo ethtool --version
	if not available, download using apt
	sudo apt install ethtool -y

2. display network interface card information(nic) with ethtool
	-first find the assigned names to all the available networks with commands like
	ip addr
	ifconfig (outdated)
	sudo ip link show ( ip command is the new network config utility)
	figure out which of this network is being used currently. look at the state of the network
	to get the nic information type
	sudo ethtool <nic name>

3.  display network usage statistics
	sudo ethtool -S <nic name>
	with this we can look at the packets sent , received and collided

4. setting of speed and modes in NICs manually
	at sometimes, auto-negotiation may fail and you nic may use the wrong speed and mode
	we can fix this with ethtool
	for example to change the ehttool settings we can use the -s option which stands for change	
	say we want to 
	sudo ethtool -s <nic name> speed 1000 duplex full autoneg off
	
	

questions that i asked myself?

1. what is a duplex?
	full duplex means you are able to send and receive data simultaneously
	half duplex means that you can either send or reveive data at a time

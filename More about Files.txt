introduction
	it has been preety basic stuff til now.We will go over some theory about files
	this will help us understand what the commands are doing even further.
materials and examples
	1. everything is a file!!
		your text file is a file is a file... thats boring
		your directory is a file..... what
		your monitor is a file.... wtf
		you are seens as a file... just kidding
	2. linux is an extensionless systems
		In windows and apple, we identify file thtough the last 2-4 characters(extensions) after the . at the 
		end of their names
		Eg. HELLO.txt   picture.png  file.exe
		In linux this is not the case. 
		Linux ignores these extensions and looks inside the file to determine what type of file it is.
		Due to this default case, it may be hard for us to know what type of file a file.
		Thus, we can check it with the command
		$file [path]
	3. linux is case sensitive
		Documents != documents
	4. space in names
		$ls Documents
		$ hello file.txt  Holiday photos
		$cd Holiday photos 
		this will give us an error. 
		this is because Holiday and photos are seens as 2 separate command line arguments
	5. quotes
		a way around this is through single quotation marks.
		anything inside is seens as a single item
	6. escape characters
		we can use the escape character called "\"
		backslash is a downward slope gradient
		a slash is an upward slope gradientds
	7. hidden files and directories
		$ls -a 
		-a option gives us the ability to see all the file inside a  directory.

Introduction
	this is straight forward, were gonna learn how to make a file system that will look elegant and clean
Materials and examples
	1. making a directory
		it is impportant that we create a data structure that will help us organize data
		$mkdir [options] <directory>
		the directory that we provide can either be a relative or an absolute.
		
		$mkdir -pv Documents/foo/bar
		$mkdir: created directory "Documents/foo"
		$mkdir: created directory "Documents/foo/bar"
		-p tells mkdir to create parents directories as needed. 
		This allows us to create deep directories on the fly. 
		-v means verbose. it will tell us what mkdir is actually doing.
		
	2. removing a directory
		$rmdir [options] <directory>
		rmdir also supports the -p and -v options just like mkdir
		Do take note that before we can delete a directory, we need to make sure that directory is empty
		these are for direcotries only, we have not reached on how to delete files.
		
	3. creating a blank file
		$touch [options] <filename>
		touch will check a directory if the file exist and if it does not,
		it creates a file of that name.
		touch is actually a command use to modify the access and the modification times of a file
		^^I am not sure how to do the above function. will update after trying
	4. copying a file or directory
		main purpose is to create a duplicate so that if something goes wrong, we can easily revert 
		back to the original
		cp [options] <source> <destination>
		both source and destination are path. 
		You can either use absolute path or relative path
		$cp filetocopy directorytopaste
		the bad thing about this is that, it can only copy 1 file into a directory
		what if i want to copy the whole directory into another?
		-r recursive allows us to do do this transfer
		recursive looks at the directory and all the files within it and looks into subdirectories
		it then copies all that into the destination directory
		$cp -r directoryToCopy  directorytopaste
	5. moving a file or directory
		$ mv [options] <source><destination>
		
	6. renaming file and directory
		normally mv will be use to move a file/directory into a new directory
		if the source and destination are from the same directory, moving that file/directory
		will result into a new name of the file.
	7. removing a file
		rm [options] <file>
		careful when removing, there is no turning back
		-r recursive is a useful option to have to delete non empty directories
		-i interactive will prompt you to ensure that the delete should be permanent.

introduction:
	We are going to be using filters ti manipulate data for us. It is a good to skim thorugh your filter notes before diving deep into piping and redirection.
	whenever we type a command into the terminal, 3 things data streams are automatically activated and connected to it.
	1.STDIN- this is data fed into program
	2.STDOUT - this is data printed by program
	3.STDERR -  for error messages
	
	Piping and redirection is the means by which we cnnect the streams between programs and files to direct data in interesting and useful ways.

materials and examples:
	> - redicrecting output to a file, instead of getting printed. 
	The terminal will automatically create it if it does not exist.
	though the data transferred is the same,the formatting of the data can be different.
	if its an existing file it will be overwritten and replace, so be really careful
	example:
	$ls > output
	this will store the result of ls into output

	>> - appending to an existing file

	<-
